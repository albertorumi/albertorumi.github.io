I am a PhD Student at  **L**aboratory for **A**rtificial **I**ntelligence and **L**earning **A**lgorithms ([LAILA](https://laila.di.unimi.it/)) and [CENTA S.p.A.](https://centai.eu/) under the supervision of Nicol√≤ Cesa-Bianchi and Fabio Vitale with a research focus on Reinforcement Learning, Online learning and multi-armed bandits. My primary research interest involves the development of algorithms that enable agents to learn from their interactions with the environment and make optimal decisions under uncertainty, granting both theoretical guarantee and empirical verifications.
